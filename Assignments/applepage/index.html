            <h4>Honoring Steve</h4>
            <p class="text2">Mr. Jobs was an amazing inspiration to millions of people, including myself. 
                As an artist I marveled at the beautiful care and craft that Steve demanded from all his products. 
                His candor and precision spoke to all of us who aspire to follow our hearts and dreams and refuse to stop creating. 
                While he will be sincerely missed, Steve will always be present in the global community he created and his numerous 
                innovations that changed the way we all live. Thank you Steve for not just creating beautiful tools but for helping 
                create a beautiful new generation. 
            </p>
